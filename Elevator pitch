Hi my name is Aleysha, I am a passionate software engineering student, striving to make applications and websites
easier to develop by using more efficient and understandable code. Currently I have been able to publish my own 
website using the fundamentals of, HTML , CSS and JavaScript. I was able to do this by using the resources in my
curriculum and my own personal research. I am currently seeking a full-stack internship so I can be able to enhance 
my skills and work independently. If you are looking for proactive, goal oriented student feel free to view my work
